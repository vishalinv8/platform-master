# Table design for add campaigns.

Supports ad filters for event and user profile data. Would want to design queries
for ad campaigns in a certain region, with filters.

This would also presumably linked to some kind of billing.

Ads could be shown on a per-user basis, or embedded within listings, or 
reserved for the featured page.
